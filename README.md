### Discover the Joys of Insanity

* Failing to meet quota means succeeding to meet a violent end!
* Lights and other things are constantly turning off as the factory is pretty "shizy"
* Enjoy optical illusions and hallucinations as you become more insane as time goes by
* Be reminded that by not feeding the dog, you are putting yourself on his menu
